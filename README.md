# Art Institute of Chicago Gallery App

## Overview

This Android app is a personal project created out of interest, hobby, and practice to explore Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app displays a gallery of featured artwork from the Art Institute of Chicago, leveraging their public API service (`api.artic.edu`).

### Features

- Browse detailed information about each artwork including title, artist, and description.
- Modern UI built using Jetpack Compose.
- Clean and intuitive design with smooth transitions and layouts.

## Reason for Creating

I created this app to further my understanding of Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It provided a great opportunity to practice API integration and implement clean UI design principles while working with a live data source.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for building the UI in a declarative way.
- **Retrofit**: Used for making API requests to the Art Institute of Chicago's API.
- **Coil**: Library for image loading and caching.
- **Coroutines**: For handling asynchronous tasks.
- **Art Institute of Chicago API**: Provides the featured artwork data.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RyanAboueljoud/art-gallery-app.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device running Android.
